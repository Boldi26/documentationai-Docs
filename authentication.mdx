## Security Best Practices

Protecting your account is crucial for maintaining privacy in a university setting.

```python
# Example secure password check
import re

def is_strong_password(password):
    return len(password) >= 8 and re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) and re.search(r'\d', password)

print(is_strong_password("SecurePass123"))  # True
```

We recommend using unique passwords, enabling 2FA, and logging out from public devices.
